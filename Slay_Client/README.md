<h1>CLIENT INFO:</h1>

Entry point for client is `Launcher.py`

You can select any server found to be running on your LAN and press connect to join
Or you can open the direct connection menu and enter IP, port to connect in that manner
Or start a local server on your LAN from within the client itself

Other menus are self explanatory
