## SLAY (W.I.P)

This is a recreation of the game Slay, originally created by Sean O'Connor in 1995, But with over the internet* multiplayer using a server and client architecture

(Currently Work In progress, dysfunctional)

There are some differences in gameplay:

- Maps are randomly generated instead of preset
- Units have fixed travel distance (2 cells)
- Theoretically infinite max players**
- New Graphics

To launch the client, use Slay_Launcher.py in the Slay_Client directory
enter port and address of the server to connect

To start server run Slay_Server.py in Slay_Server directory

\*Requires Port Forwarding to connect to servers outside your local network<br>
\*\*Due to map generation taking much longer for high player counts, and due to more players requiring a map size that might make the window too big. In practice this gets limited to moderate number of players. \<testing pending on this\>
